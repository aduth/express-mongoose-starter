# express-mongoose-starter

A very bare-bones starter app, using only Express and Mongoose. Essentially, a stripped-down version of [node-express-mongoose-demo](https://github.com/madhums/node-express-mongoose-demo).

Requirements:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) (with npm)
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)

Installation:

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/aduth/express-mongoose-starter ./my-app
$ cd my-app
$ npm install
```

After installing, start the application using Node:

```bash
$ node server.js
```

You can now view the application in your browser by navigating to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
