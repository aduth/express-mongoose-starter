# express-mongoose-starter

A very bare-bones starter app, using only Express and Mongoose. Essentially, a stripped-down version of [node-express-mongoose-demo](https://github.com/madhums/node-express-mongoose-demo).

Requirements:

* Node.js (with npm)
* MongoDB

Installation:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/aduth/express-mongoose-starter
cd express-mongoose-starter
npm install
node server.js
```
